# CookieActivityService

# We aim to find out the "Most Active Cookie" from a given csv file:

Given a cookie log file in the following format:
cookie,timestamp

We tried to implement the solution using a HashMap, wherein we read the data given in csv file and populate our HashMap with the key as cookie, and try to find most active cookie present.



# Output Screenshot : We see that our code performs as expected and we get the desired outputs. Also, exception handling is implemented.
